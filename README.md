# Quantum-Asteroids
Game that I made in ~6 hours using Game Maker. All assets were created by me or provided by Game Maker, sound was generated using www.bfxr.com.
Based on Atari's Asteroids, with my own spin on gameplay.

Controls:
Left mouse to shoot.
Right mouse to shoot.
R to restart.
Simple.

V2 added controls:
F to enable/disable full screen (Escape disables it as well), useful if clicking off screen becomes a problem.
L to enable projectiles to loop around the screen.
H to enable projectiles to hurt the player (only noticeable in loop mode).
D to enable projectile decay (only noticeable in loop mode).
B to disable the barriers (wimp) and loop around the play area freely.
